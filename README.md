Smart Saline Monitoring System using IoT

This project is an **IoT-based Smart Saline Monitoring System** designed to ensure continuous monitoring of IV saline levels for patients. It helps reduce the manual workload of hospital staff by providing **real-time alerts and data** via the **Blynk IoT platform**.

ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ“¡ **Ultrasonic Sensor** to measure the saline bottle level
- ðŸŒ¡ **DHT11 Sensor** to measure temperature and humidity
- ðŸ’¡ **LED Indicator** when saline level is safe
- ðŸš¨ **Blynk Notification** when saline level drops below 7 cm
- ðŸ”” **Buzzer Alert** if temperature exceeds 45Â°C
- ðŸ“± **Real-time Monitoring** on Blynk app (Web + Mobile)
- ðŸ”§ **Low-cost** and **easy-to-install** setup

ðŸ“² Blynk Setup

1. Create a new **Template** in [Blynk IoT Console](https://blynk.io/)
2. Assign **Virtual Pins**:
   - `V0` â€“ Temperature
   - `V1` â€“ Humidity
   - `V2` â€“ Saline Distance
3. Add Widgets:
   - **Gauge** for temperature, humidity, and distance
   - **Event Notification** named: `low_distance`
4. Copy the `BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID`, `BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME`, and `AUTH_TOKEN` into the code

## ðŸ“· How It Works

The **ultrasonic sensor** detects the distance between the sensor and the fluid level in the saline bottle. If the distance exceeds **12 cm**, the **LED turns ON**. If it falls below **7 cm**, a **Blynk notification** is sent. Meanwhile, the **DHT11 sensor** monitors temperature, triggering the **buzzer** if the environment becomes too hot (above 45Â°C).
